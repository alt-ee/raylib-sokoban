# Sokoban with Raylib (WIP)

A simple little sokoban engine built using c++ and raylib.

# Goals

My goals for this project are:

- Practice C++
- Learn the raylib library
- Practice git/github workflows, making proper use of issues, PRs etc.
- Have a working sokoban engine that can import level packs from the sokoban community.
