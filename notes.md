# Sokoban player in Raylib

# Steps to working program:
- [ ] Open .txt file containing levels
- [ ] Split file into individual levels
- [ ] Parse each level into array of enums (i.e. play grid)
- [ ] Level select
  maybe before parsing levels - only parse the selected level?
  what is the tradeoff of parsing levels when needed vs parsing all and storing in memory?
- [ ] Draw level
- [ ] Controls
- [ ] Player-box interaction
- [ ] Detect victory state
