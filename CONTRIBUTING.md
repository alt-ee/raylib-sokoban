As this is a solo project for the purposes of learning, I am really not expecting/looking for contributions from anyone else.
However I am looking to practice using github issues, pull requests, making good commits and making good use of branches.
The purpose of this file then is to document for myself a simple workflow to stick to.
This is likely to change as I work on this project and figure out the best way of doing things.
The current process is as follows:

1. Create an issue in GH for each feature/bug. Aim to provide a complete description of the change needed.
2. Create a new branch off of `main` for the change.
3. Work on the change, using atomic commits and conventional commit messages.
4. Open a PR to bring the change into main, with a brief description for myself to refer back to in the future.

Currently unsure whether raising a PR when only I will be reviewing it is actually worth doing, this might change.

## Issues
For features the initial message should be from a user interaction perspective (e.g. "the interface should look like x" etc.), and implementation details can be added in follow up messages if I need to make note of them.
